## Multi-Class Classification 

In the other folder (`one_sample`), we investigated classifying `speech` and `no_speech`. In this folder, we add on snoring samples. More specifically, the folder `speech-vs-snore-vs-nospeech` aims to train a classifier to classify `speech`, `snore`, and `no_speech`. However, before doing so, we tested `speech` vs. `snore` directly by training a binary classifier which is housed in `speech-vs-snore`. 

For the data, the only new addition is the `snore` data which was taken from a Kaggle repository [here](https://www.kaggle.com/tareqkhanemu/snoring). View `snore_sound_descriptions.txt` for more details about the `snore` data.
